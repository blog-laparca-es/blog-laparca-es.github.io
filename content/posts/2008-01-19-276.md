**I Believe In You**  
  
WHY DOES NO ONE SEEM TO UNDERSTAND  
THAT IT&#8217;S MORE THAN LOVE I NEED  
IT&#8217;S SO HARD TO KEEP YOUR FAITH ALIVE  
WHEN NOBODY ELSE BELIEVES  
OH I NEED SOMEONE THERE FOR ME  
NEED SOMEONE WHO CAN SEE  
NEED SOMEONE TO SHOW ME  
OHHHH, THAT THEY ARE THERE TO HELP ME FIGHT  
IF I FALL, TO SET ME RIGHT  
SOMEONE THERE TO HOLD THE LIGHT  
WON&#8217;T SOMEONE SAY

I BELIEVE IN YOU  
I BELIEVE IN YOU  
I BELIEVE IN YOU  
I BELIEVE IN YOU

IT&#8217;S SO HARD TO DO IT ALL YOURSELF  
FIGHTING FOR YOUR DREAMS ALONE  
WHEN THE TOY&#8217;S UPON THE HIGHEST SHELF  
A CHILD&#8217;S TEARS SOON BECOME STONE  
OH WHY DOES NO ONE LEND A HAND  
WHY DOES NO ONE UNDERSTAND  
WHY I NEED TO MAKE A STAND  
OHHHH,IT&#8217;S SO HARD TO CARRY ON  
WHEN ALL YOUR HOPE IS GONE  
ALL YOUR DREAMS HAVE COME UNDONE

I NEED TO HEAR

I BELIEVE IN YOU  
I BELIEVE IN YOU  
I BELIEVE IN YOU  
I BELIEVE IN YOU

WHY WON&#8217;T SOMEONE SAY THESE WORDS  
ARE THEY REALLY SO ABSURD?  
MUST THEY ALWAYS GO UNHEARD?  
OHHHH, IF SOMEONE NEEDED THE LIGHT  
I&#8217;D BE THERE TO HELP THEM FIGHT  
IF THEY FELL, I&#8217;D SET THEM RIGHT  
AND THEN I&#8217;D SAY

I BELIEVE IN YOU  
I BELIEVE IN YOU  
I BELIEVE IN YOU  
I BELIEVE IN YOU  
I BELIEVE IN YOU  
WON&#8217;T SOMEONE SAY I BELIEVE IN YOU  
I BELIEVE IN YOU  
WON&#8217;T SOMEONE SAY I BELIEVE IN YOU  
I NEED TO HEAR I BELIEVE IN YOU  
I BELIEVE IN YOU

No he sido capaz de encontrar una versión completa de la canción, así que hay que conformarse con esto.
