Como parece que ahora todos (riva, virc, etc.) quieren saber qué personaje de Avanza Destruye y Destrozan son y no voy a ser menos:

#  **Chaotic Neutral Human Druid Fighter**

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Alignment:</span>  
**Chaotic Neutral** characters are unstable, and frequently insane. They believe in disorder first and foremost, and will thus strive for that disorder in everything they do. This means that they will do whatever seems &#8216;fun&#8217; or &#8216;novel&#8217; at any given time.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Race:</span>  
**Humans** are the &#8216;average&#8217; race. They have the shortest life spans, and because of this, they tend to avoid the racial prejudices that other races are known for. They are also very curious and tend to live &#8216;for the moment&#8217;.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Primary Class:</span>  
**Druids** are a special variety of Cleric who serves the Earth, and can call upon the power in the earth to accomplish their goals. They tend to be somewhat fanatical about defending natural settings.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Secondary Class:</span>  
**Fighters** are the warriors. They use weapons to accomplish their goals. This isn&#8217;t to say that they aren&#8217;t intelligent, but that they _do_, in fact, believe that violence is frequently the answer.

**Detailed Results:**
