  Don&#8217;t remember where I was<br /> I realized life was a game<br /> The more seriously I took things<br /> The harder the rules became<br /> I had no idea what it&#8217;d cost<br /> My life passed before my eyes<br /> I found out how little I accomplished<br /> All my plans denied
</p>

<p align="center">
  So as you read this know my friends<br /> I&#8217;d love to stay with you all<br /> please smile when you think of me<br /> My body&#8217;s gone that&#8217;s all
</p>

<p align="center">
  A tout le monde (To all of the world)<br /> A tout mes amis (To all my friends)<br /> Je vous aime (I love you)<br /> Je dois partir (I must leave)<br /> These are the last words<br /> I&#8217;ll ever speak<br /> And they&#8217;ll set me free
</p>

  If my heart was still alive<br /> I know it would surely break<br /> And my memories left with you<br /> There&#8217;s nothing more to say
</p>

<p align="center">
  Moving on is a simple thing<br /> What it leaves behind is hard<br /> You know the sleeping feel no more pain<br /> And the living all are scarred
</p>

<p align="center">
  A tout le monde (To all of the world)<br /> A tout mes amis (To all my friends)<br /> Je vous aime (I love you)<br /> Je dois partir (I must leave)<br /> These are the last words<br /> I&#8217;ll ever speak<br /> And they&#8217;ll set me free
</p>
